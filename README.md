This project focuses on analyzing Netflix movie data to uncover insights about movie genres, popularity trends, and viewer preferences. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we performed data cleaning, transformation (like genre splitting and normalization), and various visualizations. The analysis highlights the most frequent genres on Netflix, identifies movies with the highest and lowest popularity and votes, and examines yearly trends in movie production. The goal is to derive actionable insights that could help Netflix better understand viewer interests and enhance content offerings.

The dataset includes information such as movie genres, vote averages, popularity scores, and release years. Initial steps involved dropping unnecessary columns, converting categorical data types, and breaking down the multi-genre field into individual genre rows for more granular analysis.

Key insights derived from this analysis include:

Identification of the most common movie genres available on Netflix.

Highlighting the movies with the highest and lowest average votes.

Detecting the most and least popular movies along with their respective genres.

Determining which year had the highest number of film releases.

Visualization of data distributions to understand content trends and viewer preferences.

By combining data wrangling with effective visual storytelling, this project offers valuable insights into Netflixâ€™s content landscape and helps in understanding what resonates most with audiences.
